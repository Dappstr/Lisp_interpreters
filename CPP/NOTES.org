#+TITLE: C++ Lisp Interpreter Notes

* Lexing

Create a token class which will contain an optional literal value, a token type, and methods to return the type, literal, and lexeme values.
Its constructor will take in a type, literal, and lexeme.

Optionally, overload the insertion operator to print the details of the token.

Create a class which will hold a string source, and have a current as well as starting position within it.
It will also have a vector of tokens member, along with a hash table (std::unordered_map) for the keywords.

Below are the methods, return value, and purpose:

* Parsing

We forward declare 2 types: Atom_Node and List_Node. The atom node type is responsible for holding the basic unit. List_Node will hold a list like structure such as an expression.

Optionally we make a type alias "AST_Node" to a variant which can hold an Atom_Node, and a shared pointer to List_Node
As well, we can type alias "Value"  to be a variant that can hold a double, string, or shared_ptr of List_Node's which will represent the value of the atom.

For the Atom_Node class/struct, we declare a type enumerator which is used to distinguish whether the atom is a literal or identifier. We also have the atom store a variant for a string or double.
We also have an optional string to represent an identifier.

For the Atom_Node constructors, we declare one which takes in a double, which initializes the type enumerator to a literal, and the value (variant) to the double arg.
For the second, we have the constructor take in a string, and an optional boolean argument `is_identifier` which is equal to false. The member initializer list sets the Type enumerator to true if `is_identifier` is true, otherwise sets it to false. We also initialize the "value" variant.
We also have a condition for if is_identifier is true, set the identifier optional member to the argued string.

We also define two utility methods, one for returning whether the type is a literal, and the other for is an identifier.

Next, we create three methods, 2 for returning the value from the variant member, the third for returning a pointer to the identifier member (since it's an optional)

For the List_Node type, it has a vector of AST_Node member, and two constructors, one for lvalues, one for rvalue-references. Both initialize the elements member.

We also have 4 global print functions:

| Function name | Parameters     | Return value | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| print_ast     | AST_Node, int  | void         | Check if the argued node holds an atom node (use std::holds_alternative), if so call print_atom with the value and its own argued indent amount, otherwise check if the node holds a List_Node, and if so call print_list with the dereferenced value |
| print_indent  | int            | void         | Print the argued amount of spaces                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| print_atom    | Atom_Node, int | void         | Print indent, and then check if the atom has a value (use std::holds_alternative) and if so print it                                                                                                                                                  |
| print_list    | List_Node, int | void         | Print indent, go through the list's elements, call print_ast for each element and with an indent argument, then lastly call print_indent with the indent argument argued in its own parameters                                                        |



For the actual parser class, we take in a vector of Tokens and a current index member for keeping track of where we are.
Below are the methods defined in the Parser class:

#+TODO: Start on working on evaluator and write notes for evaluator

* Evaluating

An "Environment represents a scope for which symbols and expressions are stored in. We can represent a scope/environment with a class. It'll have a (hash map) member for storing the variables, a hash map for storing the string name of a function, as welll as the actual (std::function) function, and a shared_ptr that represents the parent scope.
We can define 5 methods for an environment: the constructor, a "get" method which looks for the name in the hash table, a "define" which inserts a given variable with a value into the hash table, the "define_builtin" method for inserting (through std::move) a function into the builtins, and the "get_builtin" function, which will return an std::function which takes an argument "Value" and has an argument of a vector of Value's It will check if the argued string name matches with the builtins hash map,
otherwise if it can't, it will check if the parent member is a valid pointer, and if it is, recursively call its "get_builtin" function with the argued name, otherwise the builtin is undefined and we should throw a runtime error.

For evaluating, we define 3 functions:
| Function name | Parameters                   | Return value                                              | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|---------------+------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| eval_atom     | const atom node, environment | Value (variant: double, string, List_Node shared pointer) | Checks if argued atom is a literal, if it is, return the atom value which is a variant. Otherwise if atom is a identifier, return the value from the "get" method inside the Environment class which will find the identifier name in the hash map and return its variant value, otherwise throw a runtime error.                                             |
| eval_list     | const list node, environment | Value                                                     | Checks if list is empty, otherwise make a reference to the first (list.elements[0]) object, we also create a function object which takes a "Value" as an argument, and a vector of Value's as an argument, as well as a "Value" object representing the function                                                                                               |
| evaluate      | const AST node, environment  | Value                                                     | Returns the return value of eval_atom using std::get<Atom_Node> on the node argument and call it with the env argument, otherwise if the node is a List_Node, return eval_list with the dereferenced value using std::get<std::shared_ptr<List_Node>> on the argument, and environment argument, otherwise throw a runtime error for an unknown AST node type |

Also, we will have various "builtin" functions like operators and "print"
We define a void "initialize_builtins" which takes in an environment. The argued environment object will call the "define_builtin" function, and pass in a lambda which will take in a vector of "Value" arguments, and return a "Value".
The lambda will go through the arguments in the args vector, and will add to a "result" variable by std::get'ing the double variable and return the double. For negation, return the negative non-commutative vaalue of agrs[0]
Otherwise declare a variable to hold the resultt, and go through the arguments starting at index 1 and subtract the result from the given arguments values.
